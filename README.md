# F1TV+
I've made an extension (userscript) that adds some useful features to F1TV.
All in your browser, no external apps needed.

# Current features
- theater mode (bigger video, less wasted space on screen),
- get video/stream URL (to use in external player, like VLC)
- open video in popup (keep "original" F1TV player)
- open video in popup in alternative mode (use default HTML5 player)
- "multi-popout" - open multiple popups with synchronized streams
In multi-popout mode, you can set offset for each video, to keep them perfectly synchronized in case they are hosted out-of-sync (the main feed is usually a few seconds behind other feeds).

# Installation
1. Install the Tampermonkey extension for [CHROME](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [FIREFOX](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
2. Click here to open the latest version of userscript: [f1tv_plus.user.js](https://github.com/najdek/f1tv_plus/raw/main/f1tv_plus.user.js)
3. Tampermonkey should detect userscript automatically. Click on "Install".

You may have to allow F1TV website to open popups.
